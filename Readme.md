# Client Side 


This is just a version of my client javascript/css seed.

## Getting started

- npm install
- bower install

Install required bower packages.


### Other notes:
Separate vendor/app files for styles and scripts

Bower files would be automatically picked up.
Use the gulp-order plugin to make sure they are included in the right order
